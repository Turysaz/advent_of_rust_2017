# advent_of_rust_2017

I'm just learning to use Rust, so do not use any of this code as a reference or something.
It's probably very bad.

If you want to help me to learn Rust though, feel free to open a pull request that show how to do things better. ;-)

My "real" solutions are written in python and can be found [here](https://github.com/turysaz/advent_of_python_2017).
